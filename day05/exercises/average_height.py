# Instructions
# You are going to write a program that calculates the average student height from a List of heights.

# e.g. student_heights = [180, 124, 165, 173, 189, 169, 146]

# The average height can be calculated by adding all the heights together and dividing by the total number of heights.

# e.g.

# 180 + 124 + 165 + 173 + 189 + 169 + 146 = 1146

# There are a total of 7 heights in student_heights

# 1146 Ã· 7 = 163.71428571428572

# Average height rounded to the nearest whole number = 164

# Important You should not use the sum() or len() functions in your answer. You should try to replicate their functionality using what you have learnt about for loops.

# Input a Python list of student heights

# Transforming each item in the list as an integer value
student_heights = input().split()
for n in range(0, len(student_heights)):
    student_heights[n] = int(student_heights[n]) 
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†
  
# Write your code below this row ðŸ‘‡ 

total_height = 0

# sum()
for height in student_heights:
    total_height += height
print(f"total height = {total_height}")

total_students = 0

# len()
for student in student_heights:
    total_students += 1
print(f"number of students = {total_students}")

average_height = round(total_height / total_students)
print(f"average height = {average_height}")
